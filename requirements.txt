# ULTIMA Framework Dependencies
# Core async and system libraries

# No additional dependencies required for foundation
# System uses only Python standard library:
# - asyncio (async/await support)
# - pathlib (cross-platform paths)
# - json (serialization)
# - logging (structured logging)
# - subprocess (system commands)
# - signal (graceful shutdown)

# Future dependencies will be added as agents are implemented:
# - requests (HTTP client for web agents)
# - playwright (browser automation)
# - pyautogui (GUI automation)
# - ollama-python (local LLM integration)
# - docker (container management)

# Development dependencies:
# - pytest (testing framework)
# - black (code formatting)
# - mypy (type checking)
